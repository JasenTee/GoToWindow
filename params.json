{"name":"Go To Window","tagline":"A keyboard-maniac alt-tab alternative","body":"# Go To Window\r\n\r\nNo more need for alt-tabbing through dozens of windows, or looking for your windows in the task bar. Simply press `Alt` + `Tab`, type a few characters from the window title or process name you want to switch to and press enter. \r\n\r\nFor the keyboard maniacs.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nLaunch `GoToWindow.exe`. You can also place it in in the Windows Startup menu to launch it automatically with Windows.\r\n\r\n* Press `Alt` + `Tab` to open the windows list. All windows are shown, with the most recently accessed first.\r\n\r\n* Press `Enter` to go to the previously accessed window (same behavior as standard Windows `Alt` + `Tab`)\r\n\r\n* Press the `Up` and `Down` arrows to navigate in the list, and press `Enter` to switch to the application.\r\n\r\n* Start typing keywords to filter the list. Note that only windows that contain all words in either the window title _or_ the process name will be shown.\r\n\r\n* If no opened window is found, press `Enter` to search directly in the Windows Search charm.\r\n\r\n* Press `Alt` + `Number (1 - 9)` to directly open the application at the selected index from the list.\r\n\r\n* Press `Escape` to close the window.\r\n\r\n## Tips and gotchas\r\n\r\n* To switch to an application that has elevated privileges (Run as Administrator), GoToWindow must also run with elevated privileges.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n  * [Christian Rondeau](https://github.com/christianrondeau) - Main Developer\r\n  * [David Cote](https://github.com/cotedav) - User Interface Design\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Christian Rondeau.
