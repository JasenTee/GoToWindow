# Go To Window

**This is not yet even alpha**

No more need for alt-tabbing through dozens of windows, or looking for your windows in the task bar. Simply press a shortcut, type a few letters from the window title or process name and press enter. 

For the keyboard maniacs.

## Usage

Since this is not even alpha, you'll have to build the software and bind a shortcut yourself.

Once the main window is opened, either use the arrows to navigate or type something, and press enter to focus the window. Press escape to close.
